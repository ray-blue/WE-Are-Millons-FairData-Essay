                Why Is Fair Data Important?

                Fair Data Principles make data valuable and easier to find through unique identifiers. 
                Hence, making it easier to combine and integrate, thanks to formal shared knowledge 
                representation. Such data can be reused and repurposed and shared. Because machines 
                have the means to understand where the data comes from and what it is about. It also 
                accelerates research, boosts cooperation and facilitates reuse in scientific research. 
                Policy Makers and stakeholders have begun seeing  the value and benefits of these principles 
                and are pushing for this new innovation.

                What is need for Data Sovereignty?
            </h2>

        <div>
            <p>
                Firstly let us understand what Data Sovereignty is and how we can change it. 
                Data sovereignty is the concept of information which has been converted and 
                stored in binary, digital form. Which is subject to the laws of the country 
                where you're located. Over the years concerns surrounding data sovereignty 
                relating to privacy and ownership have been on the rise. Governments and 
                organizations have failed to follow regulations and prevent data leaks and 
                breeches. In order to strengthen sovereignty and on setting standards, focusing 
                on these few aspects could be the pieces needed for data sovereignty.
                <div style="width: 90%; margin: auto;">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adopting technologies that respect and value personal data. While boosting the growth potential of the digital economy</li>
                        <li>Empowering citizens to be aware of how they act and interact with data.</li>
                        <li>Building a climate-neutral and resource-efficient economy</li>
                        <li>Creating a fair Digital Market where business can compete on equal terms and individuals rights are respected.</li>
                        <li>Improving access to digital goods and services across the world, for consumers, business and individuals.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                With enough advocacy, accessibility and user friendly platforms that will allow for seamless migration setting sovereignty 
                standards can definitely become a reality.

                It's very important for us to distinguish between Privacy and Freedom;
                <div style="width: 90%; margin: auto;">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Privacy The State of being private; the state of not being seen by others</li>
                        <li>Freedom (uncountable) The state of being free, of not being imprisoned or 
                            enslaved (countable) The lack of a specific constraint,or of constraints 
                            in general; a state of being free unconstrained.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                The age of technology has come to the biggest soft threats. Over the years it has 
                been simple for third-parties to collect data that technology makes transparent from 
                who you called, what you spent and where you drove. Making it very easy to find a pattern 
                in that data that could be false or misleading. Many people have suffered from misinterpreted 
                data that has been collected and verified.
                <br>
                We have to start looking at personal data. As part of our identities, nobody should have access 
                or be allowed to use personal data without an individual's consent.

            <h2>
                Fair Data Economy.

                For a human driven and fair data economy to work. It should be based on three factors: ethical values, 
                technology, and new business models. With a human -driven approach, individual and social interest should 
                determine the business conditions and data used would be of benefit to individuals and society.
                <br>
                When developing a fair data economy, the aim has been to use existing technologies, operating models 
                and concepts across boundaries between different sectors, However this method may not be sustainable 
                because old infrastructure and policy would still be in use. THe goal should be to enable not only a new 
                data based business but new technologies that are built around FAIR DATA. But also easier digital everyday 
                life. That is based on more efficient and personal management of data.
                <br>
                Moving toward the fair use of data will require sustainable solutions. Organizations that  operate 
                responsibly will be able to participate in trust-based data-sharing ecosystems in which the value of 
                data increases. Therefore the use of data is combined with a people oriented approach and model in which 
                different parties have common ground rules for sharing data and using it in services.

                Web3s focus is to create a fairer, more equitable web experience.Having control over personal

                developing infrastructure and dApps that are promoting a fairer data economy such as.

            Based on the roadmap, Fairdrive has the potential to promote personal data ownership.In a safe environment 
            whereby users are in control of their personal data . Here is a brief description of the type of environment 
            Fairdrive is working on creating.

                        commonly used data-structures, that give opportunity for a dApp to interpret the produced data of 
                        another dApp; and also allows for users to easily transfer their data from one application to another,

                Blockchain, an early stage technology which is enabling decentralized and secure storage and transfer of information, 
                could become a powerful tool for tracking transactions that can minimize friction, reduce corruption, increase trust 
                and empower users. I am really excited to see how Fairdrive will be shaping the future of personal data.
